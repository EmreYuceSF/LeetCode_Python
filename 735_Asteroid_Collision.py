def asteroidCollision(asteroids: list[int]):
    """
    Simulates the collision of asteroids moving in different directions and returns a list of asteroids
    after the collisions have been resolved.

    Parameters:
        asteroids (list[int]): A list of integers representing the directions of asteroids. Positive
                               integers indicate asteroids moving to the right, and negative integers
                               indicate asteroids moving to the left.

    Returns:
        list[int]: A list of integers representing the directions of asteroids after the collisions
                   have been resolved.

    Algorithm:
        1. Insert a '0' at the beginning of the asteroids list to act as a placeholder to simplify the code.
        2. Define a recursive function 'recursion' to simulate asteroid collisions.
        3. The 'found' variable is used to determine if any collisions occurred during an iteration.
        4. Loop through the asteroids list in reverse order to handle collisions from right to left.
        5. If an asteroid is negative (moving left) and the one before it is positive (moving right), a collision is found.
        6. If the absolute value of the left-moving asteroid is smaller than the right-moving one,
           remove the left asteroid from the list (as it gets destroyed).
        7. If the absolute value of the left-moving asteroid is larger than the right-moving one,
           remove the right asteroid from the list (as it gets destroyed).
        8. If both asteroids have the same absolute value, remove both from the list (as they destroy each other).
        9. Continue this process until no more collisions are found in an iteration.
       10. Call the 'recursion' function to handle subsequent collisions if any were found.
       11. Return the list of asteroids after the collisions have been resolved, excluding the placeholder '0'.
